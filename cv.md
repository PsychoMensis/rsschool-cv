#### About me
Hi, I am here to learn something new about frontend development! I don't have much experience, but I'm trying. I've had some experience with C#, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Git. Looking forward to learn JS and expand my knowledge about the software engineering and algorithms. I'm using VS  for C#, and VS Code for HTML/CSS/JS. 
#### Work Experience
I don't have any commercial experience at all, but now I'm about to finish my university. Btw I'm doing my Graduation Work and it is directly linked with frontend development!
#### Education

All of my knowledgement about software engineering come from free web resourses (mostly YouTube) and some books about algorithms. 
#### English
I am very bad with grammatics, but I can read english documents without any problems, listening and speaking are at OK level :)
